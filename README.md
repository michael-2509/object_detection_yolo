# YOLOv8 Object Detection

This code showcases the use of YOLOv8, the latest version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, to run object detection on images and videos. YOLOv8 is a fast and accurate object detection model that uses a single convolutional neural network to process an image and make predictions about the presence and location of objects.

- Clone repository:

  `git clone [githuburl] `

- Create a virtual environment and install the requirement files

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
